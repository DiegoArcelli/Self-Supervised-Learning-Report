In conclusion, this work explored various self-supervised learning methods for computer vision. The general framework of self-supervised learning was discussed, highlighting its advantages of learning from unlabeled data and the potential for transferring learned representations to downstream tasks. Different self-supervised learning methods were described in detail and compared. The empirical results highlight that the two best performing models on the downstream tasks are BYOL and SWAV. Also SimCLR and MoCo while CPC, CMC and PIRL are the worst performer.
